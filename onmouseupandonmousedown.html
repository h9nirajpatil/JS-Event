        // when you click and hold the mouse button on the "Click Me" div, its background color turns red, and its text changes to "Release Me". When you release the mouse button, the background color changes back to green, and the text changes to "Thank You". These changes are achieved by dynamically modifying the div element's styles and inner content using JavaScript.
