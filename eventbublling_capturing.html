    There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM, bubbling and capturing.

Event propagation is a way of defining the element order when an event occurs. If you have a <p> element inside a <div> element, and the user clicks on the <p> element, which element's "click" event should be handled first?

In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer: the <p> element's click event is handled first, then the <div> element's click event.

In capturing the outer most element's event is handled first and then the inner: the <div> element's click event will be handled first, then the <p> element's click event.

With the addEventListener() method you can specify the propagation type by using the "useCapture" parameter:

addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
The default value is false, which will use the bubbling propagation, when the value is set to true, the event uses the capturing propagation.

    <!-- example -->
    <h2>JavaScript addEventListener()</h2>

    <div id="myDiv1">
        <h2>Bubbling:</h2>
        <p id="myP1">Click me!</p>
    </div><br>

    <div id="myDiv2">
        <h2>Capturing:</h2>
        <p id="myP2">Click me!</p>
    </div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("myP1").addEventListener("click", function () {
            alert("You clicked the white element!");
        }, false);

        document.getElementById("myDiv1").addEventListener("click", function () {
            alert("You clicked the orange element!");
        }, false);

        document.getElementById("myP2").addEventListener("click", function () {
            alert("You clicked the white element!");
        }, true);

        document.getElementById("myDiv2").addEventListener("click", function () {
            alert("You clicked the orange element!");
        }, true);
    </script>
    <!-- 
        HTML Structure:

The document contains two sets of <div> elements, each with an <h2> heading and a <p> paragraph inside.
Each <p> element has an ID of myP1 and myP2 respectively.
Each <div> element has an ID of myDiv1 and myDiv2 respectively.
CSS Styling:

The CSS styles define the appearance of the elements. myDiv1 and myDiv2 have a background color of coral and padding of 50 pixels. myP1 and myP2 have a background color of white, font size of 20 pixels, a border of 1 pixel solid, and padding of 20 pixels.
JavaScript Event Listeners:

Event listeners are added to the <p> and <div> elements using the addEventListener() method.
For myP1, a click event listener is added with a callback function that alerts "You clicked the white element!". This listener is set to use bubbling (false as the third argument).
For myDiv1, a click event listener is added with a callback function that alerts "You clicked the orange element!". This listener is also set to use bubbling (false as the third argument).
For myP2, a click event listener is added with a callback function that alerts "You clicked the white element!". This listener is set to use capturing (true as the third argument).
For myDiv2, a click event listener is added with a callback function that alerts "You clicked the orange element!". This listener is also set to use capturing (true as the third argument).
Event Propagation:

With bubbling, the innermost element's event is handled first, then the outer. So, when you click on myP1, you will see "You clicked the white element!" followed by "You clicked the orange element!".
With capturing, the outermost element's event is handled first, then the inner. So, when you click on myP2, you will see "You clicked the orange element!" followed by "You clicked the white element!".
In summary, this code demonstrates how event propagation works in HTML DOM and how you can use the addEventListener() method to specify whether an event should use bubbling or capturing.
